-------------STOPWATCHFACTORY------------
method getStopwatch 
could have used a hashmap or some other type of list that does not permit duplicates 
instead of looping thru a list.  But then would of sacrificed the use of CopyOnWriteArrayList(for concurrent access)
NullPointerException is caught (because parameter value is null where prohibited) as an IllegalArgumentException when checking the id.

method getStopwatches() 
should not be using a suppress warning, clone should be done manually instead of using this method to avoid this suppression.
good use of CopyOnWriteArrayList for concurrent accessing (assuming StopWatch creation is not always happening).

------------STOPWATCHCREATOR-------------

A single Stop watch can't be used since the class StopwatchCreator is package protected, 

Good use of more General type List

line 53 of start method is redundant because PastTime and LapTime stored is the same when clock was stopped

it is better to lock on an object rather than synchronize the method definitions

equals could simply be the id being equal to what is compared since it is already inmutable it wont make
a difference and there will never be equal objects since the StopwatchCreator only works thru the factory
hash code could also be based on the ID
HashCode and Equals shouldn't be so .
