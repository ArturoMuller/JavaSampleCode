------Contact-------------------
contact name is mutable classes should be ummutable unless theres a very good reason to make them mutable.  You should always make small value objects immutable.


line 57 throws a number format exception that is not necessary becuase parse int on line 55 already throws this exception.
Fix line 57 throw an IlegalArgumentException, which is more appropriate.

line 69 thru 74 it would be helpful to check the email format and make sure it is correct if not throw an IlegalArgumentException

the equals method is not properly written because if I pass a String Object and a String primitive in the builder the two instances are not equal 
instead of using ==  what should be used is the .equals this behavior is correct in the hashCode and hashCode and String have to be equivalent

missing a toString method to print a contact



-----AdressBook-----------------
it is ok to have a universal search field but as per the PS1 instructions there is supposed to be a search for every field in a contact and this was not provided.

it would be nice is export contact could also take a java File Object not only a String 
ExportContact should catch an IOexception instead of just an exception and also throw an IOException if write is unsucesful in order to know what was wrong.

Import Contact should throw an IOException
