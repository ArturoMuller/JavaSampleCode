FILTER ITERATOR
===


This project is an undirected GRAPH with generic node values and Integer edge weights.
The Graph class returns an iterator that can be iterated by using DFS and BFS algorithms
The Filter Iterator works the same way as the mentioned one exept that it filters out any 
predicates used it's constructor


**Package graph** contains the graph and all its classes 

**Package graphTest** contains a test for all public clsess
